Ralph Wiggum Loop - Iteration 1 Report

Summary
- Goal was to exercise Open Agent workspace + mission orchestration via docs/MISSION_API.md and docs/WORKSPACE_API.md.
- I could not reach an authenticated Open Agent API instance, so no missions/workspaces were created.

Environment discovery
- Checked for AGENTS.md: none found.
- Found example env config at .env.example (points to OPENCODE_BASE_URL http://127.0.0.1:4096; server PORT=3000).
- Enumerated listening ports: 3000, 3001, 4096, 5000, 7000 among others.

API connectivity attempts
1) http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces
   - Response: HTML 404 (served by a Next.js app branded Oraxen Studio).
   - Conclusion: not the Open Agent API.

2) http://localhost:3001/api/workspaces
   - Response: full HTML app shell (Next.js), not JSON.
   - Conclusion: likely another frontend, no API.

3) http://127.0.0.1:4096/api/workspaces and /api/health
   - Response: OpenCode HTML shell (not JSON) for both endpoints.
   - Conclusion: OpenCode UI server is running but does not expose Open Agent API here.

4) http://localhost:5000/api/workspaces, /api/health, /api/auth/login
   - Response: HTTP 403 with empty body.
   - Conclusion: access blocked; likely requires auth or is not the Open Agent API.
   - Tried login with password "change-me" (from .env.example): still 403.

5) http://localhost:7000/api/workspaces, /api/auth/login
   - Response: HTTP 403 with empty body.
   - Conclusion: same as port 5000.

Requested scenarios and what happened
- Create ubuntu template workspace (with github skill): blocked by missing API access.
- Agent builds web app, runs Playwright, pushes to GitHub: blocked by missing API access + no auth token.
- Ralph loop task: cannot launch without mission creation.
- oh-my-opencode agents (Sisyphus, etc.): cannot start missions without API access.
- Non-programming task that requires custom tool: cannot run without missions.
- dgx-spark workspace tasks (ComfyUI Stable Diffusion 3.5, self-hosted LLM): cannot access workspace or launch missions.
- Lean proof in dedicated workspace: cannot create workspace.

Issues encountered
- Open Agent API endpoint not reachable from this environment.
- Missing JWT token or auth flow for /api/auth/login (all tested ports returned 403).
- No documentation in-repo indicating which port/service actually exposes the Open Agent API for this workspace.

Fixes attempted
- Tried multiple ports based on lsof output (3000/3001/4096/5000/7000).
- Tried default dashboard password "change-me" (from .env.example) with /api/auth/login.

Fixes needed (to proceed)
- Provide the correct Open Agent API base URL and port.
- Provide a valid JWT token or dashboard password to obtain one.
- Confirm whether the API server should be running locally or is remote.

Workspaces created/cleaned
- No workspaces were created, so nothing to clean up.

Next suggested steps
- Supply the correct API base URL and credentials.
- If the API server is expected to run locally, provide startup command or ensure it is running.
- Once access is available, I can retry all requested mission/workspace workflows and update this report.

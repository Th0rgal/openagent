Your job is to try this orchestrator for cloud agents. You will use docs/MISSION_API.md and docs/WORKSPACE_API.md
to be able to start missions and create workspaces. Your job is specifically to test
many workflows and tasks, and generate me a report of where the agents struggle.

You will create a file report.txt in which you describe all the things you tried and what
went good or wrong. You will not stop working before 6am. If it is not yet 6am, I want you
to brainstorm new things to try and test.

At the end I want you to clean all the isolated workspaces you have created.

I would like you to explore:

- The fact of creating workspaces based on the ubuntu template (with github skill installed, etc)
- Asking an agent to build a simple web app, test it with playwright, push the code to a new github repo (see if it can commit, etc)
- Asking an agent to do a task that requires a ralph loop (see if it succeeds, otherwise why not)
- You will use agents provided by oh-my-opencode (Sisyphus, etc). Try them, see what are best for what.
- You will ask agent to do task that are not related to programming but might require it to build a custom tool (for example to wait until it finds a transaction whose hash start by 0x000 on Starknet and logs its id)
- Asking an agent inside the dgx-spark workspace to install the last version of Stable Diffusion (3.5 I believe) in ComfyUI, and use it to generate beautiful images of dragons (download the best 3 images here).
- Asking an agent to start a service on the dgx spark following the openai http API providing a self hosted LLM inference (may be a small gpt-oss or something similar)
- Write a basic proof in lean, and verify it (in a dedicated lean workspace)


Keep tracks of the best results. When an agent fails for a reason you can fix (workspace wrongly setup, etc), and is 
generic (not specific only to this task), and it makes sense to fix it for our generic orchestrator,
please fix it and restart the task to ensure it works, until it is fixed.

You will mention in changes.txt all the changes you have done (at least do an overview of them).

Again, remember, your goal is really to ensure agents can work well in the cloud via Open Agent,
for this you may have to fix their environment (workspaces), but that should be enough.

You may create new workspace templates for some missions where you believe that is relevant.
